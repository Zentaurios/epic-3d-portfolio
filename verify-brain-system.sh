echo "📋 Implementation Summary:"
echo "  • Real anatomical brain model (11 brain regions)"
echo "  • Z-index layering system (background + foreground)"
echo "  • Neural activity based on user interactions"
echo "  • Fixed geometry (no buffer resizing errors)"
echo "  • Performance optimized with LOD system"
echo "  • Accessibility support (reduced motion, etc.)"
echo ""

echo "🚀 To test the system:"
echo "  1. Run: npm run dev"
echo "  2. Visit: http://localhost:3000/brain-demo"
echo "  3. Check console for brain activity logs"
echo "  4. Test scroll interactions and navigation"

echo "🔧 Key Features Implemented:"
echo "  ✅ Background brain layer (z-index: -1)"
echo "  ✅ Content layer (z-index: 10)" 
echo "  ✅ Foreground brain layer (z-index: 50)"
echo "  ✅ Navigation layer (z-index: 99999)"
echo "  ✅ Brain region switching (consciousness/memory/creativity/logic)"
echo "  ✅ Neural activity based on scroll velocity"
echo "  ✅ Anatomically accurate brain lobes"
echo "  ✅ Fixed geometry (no WebGL errors)"
